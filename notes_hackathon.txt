summary of what I wrote down:

- It's a small web application where "clients" can take a "quiz" to see if they can differentiate between AI content and human content
- Languages: HTML with JS frontend, backend isn't a must-have, but it could be a nice thing to have
- the page consists of a title with FH logo, short description, the quiz itself a submit button?
- if everything or a certain percentage is correct then we generate a code, code starts at for example 2130
- the quiz needs to be solvable for old men that are a bit tipsy
- 3-5 images per quiz
- nice-to-have: random sets of questions
- quiz images can be stored in project folder
- nice-to-have: backend, can be used to store the already generated numbers, with a possible overview page that can be used to see which numbers have already been generated
- nice-to-have: display of correctness instead of generation of the code and someone else hands the person a code? -> can be done using an alert

The must-haves as of right now:
- The HTML web page
- JS code to make examples appear
- the examples
- Printing a result code starting at 2130
