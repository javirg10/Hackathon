## Topic
Quiz to see if people can discern between AI-Generated Content and Human Content.

## How it Works
Each image has a radio button with 2 values, Human and AI, for each image you have to discern whether or not the image was created by Humans or created by an AI. The default selected option is Human on all Images. After pressing the submit button on the bottom of the page, your score will be calculated and if you have a passing score, a unique code is generated.
